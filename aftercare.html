                <p>After care! Your tan will begin to develop over the next 2-4 hours. I do not recommend showering for
                    at
                    least 6-8 hours. Do not apply makeup, deodorant or lotion until after showering. I usually recommend
                    spray tanning in the evening then showering in the morning. If any spray tan gets on your sheets or
                    clothes it easily comes out in the wash. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! Keeping your skin
                    hydrated
                    with a good non mineral based lotion is key to extending your tan. Note: swimming in chlorinated
                    water
                    or the beach will shorten the length of your tan.</p>
